          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>I have lived in Colorado my whole life right outside of Boulder. I am a junior studying advertising with a CTD minor. This summer I got the amazing opportunity to be a media intern for Camp Wicosuta. I took daily photos of campers, designed a years worth of social media posts, created a yearbook and made a slideshow for the campers. After graduation I want to either be a photographer or a art director for an ad agency, hopefully in NYC. I am also part of many clubs here at CU Boulder, I was just promoted to be the assistant manager of communications at The Bold, which is a media publication. I am also part of Verve which is a street hip hop team and I run our social media. I have so far loved all the CTD classes and can't wait to get into this class. Coding is not something that comes easy to me, but I like to ask questions and I like knowing what each things means so I can do it on my own later on.</p>
